In this chapter we will explore more detailed explanations of specific functionality.


****************
Using Batch mode
****************

Batch mode is meant to be used when you want to automate your code as Python scripts.

In batch mode, any method that would normally display results, returns a Python dictionary
instead and with two keys; LOG, LST. This is the same as how the submit() method works 
normally. 

The LOG has the SAS Log and the LST contains the results. You will likely want to set 
the results parameter to HTML (this was originally the default instead of Pandas). When
you set the results to HTML, not only are plots and graphs in HTML, but also tabular results
too.

The example below shows the contents of a Python script that runs a linear regression and 
writes all the results to a directory. You can access the directory with a web browser to
view these results by clicking on them. Adjust the filesystem path below and you should 
be able to run this code yourself.


.. code-block:: ipython3

    #! /usr/bin/python3.5
    
    import saspy
    sas = saspy.SASsession(results='html')
    
    cars = sas.sasdata('cars', libref='sashelp')
    
    sas.set_batch(True)
    
    stat = sas.sasstat()
    res = stat.reg(model='horsepower = Cylinders EngineSize', data=cars)
    
    for i in range(len(res._names)):
        x = res.__getattr__(res._names[i])
        if type(x) is not str:
            out1 = open("C:\\Public\\saspy_demo\\"+res._names[i]+".html", mode='w+b')
            out1.write(x['LST'].encode())
            out1.close()
        else:
            out1 = open("C:\\Public\\saspy_demo\\"+res._names[i]+".log", mode='w+b')
            out1.write(x.encode())
            out1.close()
    
    
The URL to see these results is: file:///C:/Public/saspy_demo/. Of course, you can
imagine integrating the results into nicer web page for reporting, but with nothing more 
than this few lines of code, you can have the results updated and refreshed by just 
re-running the script.

 
*********
Prompting
*********

There are two types of prompting that can be performed; meaning to stop processing and
prompt the user for input and then resume processing.

The first type of prompting is performed implicity. When you run the 
SASsession() method, if any required parameters for the chosen connection method 
were not specified in the configuration definition (in sascfg_personal.py), processing is interrupted 
so that the user can be prompted for the missing parameters. In addition, when there 
is more than one configuration definition in SAS_config_names, and cfgname is not 
specified in the SASsession() method (or an invalid name is specified), the user will 
be prompted to select the configuration definition to use.

The other kind of prompting is prompting that you control. The submit() method, 
and the saslib() methods both take an optional prompt parameter. This parameter 
is how you request to have the user prompted for input at run time. This option 
is used in conjunction with SAS macro variable names that you enter in the SAS 
code or options for the method.

The prompt parameter takes a Python dictionary. The keys are the SAS macro variable 
names and the values are True or False. The Boolean value indicates whether it 
is to hide what the user types in or not. It also controls whether the macro variables 
stay available to the SAS session or if they are deleted after running that code. 

You will be prompted for the values of your keys, and those values will be assigned
to the SAS macro variables for you in SAS. When your code runs, the macro variables will be 
resolved. If you specified ``True``, then the value the user types is not displayed, 
nor is the macro variable displayed in the SAS log, and the macro variable is deleted 
from SAS so that it is not accessible after that code submission. For ``False``, the 
user can see the value as it is type, the macro variables can be seen in the SAS log 
and the variables remain available in that SAS session for later code submissions.

The following are examples of how to use prompting in your programs. The first example 
uses the saslib() method to assign a libref to a third-party database. This is a
common issue--the user needs to specify credentials, but you do not want to include
user IDs and passwords in your programs. Prompting enables the user to provide
credentials at runtime.

.. code-block:: ipython3

    sas.saslib('Tera', engine='Teradata', options='user=&user pw=&mypw server=teracop1', 
               prompt={'user': False, 'mypw': True})

At runtime, the user is prompted for user and password and sees something like the
following when entering values (the user ID is visible and the password is obscured):

.. parsed-literal::

    Please enter value for macro variable user sasdemo
    Please enter value for macro variable mypw ........
 
Another example might be that you have code that creates a table, but you want to let 
the user choose the table name as well as the name of the column and a hidden value 
to assign to it. By specifing ``False``, the user can see the value, and the SAS log 
shows the non-hidden macro mariables, followed by another code submission that uses 
the previously defined non-hidden variables--which are still available.

.. code-block:: ipython3

    ll = sas.submit('''
    data &dsname;
      do &var1="&pw"; 
        output; 
      end;
    run;
    ''', prompt={'var1': False, 'pw': True, 'dsname': False})


.. parsed-literal::

    Please enter value for macro variable var1 MyColumnName
    Please enter value for macro variable hidden ........
    Please enter value for macro variable dsname TestTable1    
    
    print(ll['LOG'])

    103  ods listing close;ods html5 (id=saspy_internal) file=stdout options(bitmap_mode='inline') device=svg; ods graphics on /
    103! outputfmt=png;
    NOTE: Writing HTML5(SASPY_INTERNAL) Body file: STDOUT
    104  
    105  options nosource nonotes;
    108  %let var1=MyColumnName;
    109  %let dsname=TestTable1;
    110  
    111  data &dsname;
    112    do &var1="&hidden";
    113      output;
    114    end;
    115  run;
    NOTE: The data set WORK.TESTTABLE1 has 1 observations and 1 variables.
    NOTE: DATA statement used (Total process time):
          real time           0.00 seconds
          cpu time            0.00 seconds
          
    116  
    117  proc print data=&dsname;
    118  run;

    124  ods html5 (id=saspy_internal) close;ods listing;


    HTML(sas.submit('''
    proc print data=&dsname;
    run;
    ''')['LST'])

    Obs     MyColumnName
    1       cant see me


That is a highly contrived example, but you get the idea. You can prompt users 
at runtime for values you want to use in the code, and those values can be 
kept around and used later in the code, or hidden and inaccessible afterward.


***************************************************************
Moving values between Python Variables and SAS Macro Variables
***************************************************************

There are two methods on the SASsession object you can use to transfer values between Python and SAS.
symget() and symput(). To get a value from a SAS Macro Variable and assign it to a Python variable you
just call symget with the name of the macro variable.

.. code-block:: ipython3

    py_var = sas.symget(sas_macro_var)

To set the value of a SAS Macro Variable using the value of a Python variable, use symput() specifying
the macro variable name, and providing the python variable continaing the value.

.. code-block:: ipython3

    py_var = some_value
    sas.symput(sas_macro_var, py_var)

For a much better set of examples and use cases with these two methods, check out the notebook in saspy-examples:
https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy-examples/blob/master/SAS_contrib/Using_SYMGET_and_SYMPUT.ipynb



******************************************************************************
Slow performance loading SAS data into a Pandas DataFrame ( to_df(), sd2df() )
******************************************************************************

Transferring data from SAS into Python (and the reverse) has been in this module from the beginning. As usage of this has grown, 
larger sized data sets have been shown to be much slower to load and consume lots of memory. After investigations, this has to do with
trying to build out the dataframes 'in memory'. This works fine up to a point, but the memory consumption and CPU usage doesn't scale.

I've made enhancements to the algorithm, so it will work, as opposed to run indefinitely consuming too many resources, but it is still
too slow.

So, I've added a second method for doing this, using a CSV file as an intermediate store, then using the Pandas read_csv() method to create
the dataframe. This performs significantly faster, as it doesn't consume memory for storing the data in python objects. The read_csv() method
is much faster than trying to append data in memory as it's streamed into python from SAS.

There is now a parameter for these methods to specify which method to use: method=['MEMORY' | 'CSV'].
The default is still MEMORY. But you can specify CSV to use this new method: to_df(method='CSV'), sd2df(method='CSV').

There are also alias routines which specify this for you: to_df_csv() and sd2df_csv().

Another optimization with this is when saspy and SAS are on the same machine. When this is the case, there is no transfer required.
The CSV file written by SAS is the file specified in read_csv(). For remote connections, the CSV file still needs to be transferred from
SAS to saspy and written to disk locally for the read_csv() method. This is still significantly faster for larger data.


*****************************************************************************
Using Proc iomoperate to find Object Spawner hosts and Workspace Server ports
*****************************************************************************

If you already use a client to connect to IOM servers, you may have the host and port to OMR
(the SAS Metadata Server), but not necessarily those of the Object Spawners or Workspace Servers.
For Remote IOM connections there are three configuration keys that require some of this other information.
If you can connect to your OMR Server, then you can use the following code to find out the information you need.

The three configuration keys are:

.. code-block:: ipython3

    iomhost - 
        (Required) The resolvable host name, or IP address to the IOM object spawner.
        New in 2.1.6; this can be a list of all the object spawners hosts if you have load balanced object spawners.
        This provides Grid HA (High Availability)
    iomport - 
        (Required) The port that object spawner is listening on for workspace server connections (workspace server port - not object spawner port!).
    appserver -
        If you have more than one AppServer defined on OMR, then you must pass the name of the physical workspace server
        that you want to connect to, i.e.: 'SASApp - Workspace Server'. Without this the Object spawner will only try the
        first one in the list of app servers it supports.


First, query to find any available Object Spawners. You would use the 'Machine name :' value(s) from
this for the 'iomhost' configuration key. Note that often there will only be one Object Spawner, but
there can be more then one configured.

.. code-block:: ipython3

    proc iomoperate
      uri="iom://omrhost.abc.xyz.com:8561;Bridge;USER=omruserid,PASS=omrpasswd";
      list DEFINED FILTER="Object";
    quit;

The reuslts from this should include output like the following for any defined Object Spawners.
Use the 'Machine name :' value for your 'iomhost' key.

.. code-block:: ipython3

    Object Spawner - objhost (A5H4N590.AY000003)
        Server class : IOM Spawner
        Spawnable server component : Operating System Services - objhost
        Spawnable server component : SASApp - Pooled Workspace Server
        Spawnable server component : SASApp - Stored Process Server
        Spawnable server component : SASApp - Workspace Server
        Operator port : 8581
        PortBank port : 8801
        PortBank port : 8811
        PortBank port : 8821
        Machine name : objhost.abc.xyz.com


Next, query to find any available Workspace Servers. You would use the 'Bridge port :' value from
this for the 'iomport' configuration key. When you have multiple Workspace Servers configured, which
really means you have multipe SASApp's defined (see 'Server context :' value in the output below), 
you will want to set the 'appserver' configuration key to the SASApp Workspace Server that you want
to (or have permission to) connect to. The value to use is the name shown in the output for the server;
'SASApp - Workspace Server' in the output below.  

.. code-block:: ipython3

    proc iomoperate
      uri="iom://omrhost.abc.xyz.com:8561;Bridge;USER=omruserid,PASS=omrpasswd";
      list DEFINED FILTER="- Workspace";
    quit;

The reuslts from this should include output like the following for any defined Workspace Servers.
Use the 'Bridge port :' value for your 'iomport' key.

.. code-block:: ipython3

    SASApp - Workspace Server (A5H4N590.AY000009)
        Server class : 440196D4-90F0-11D0-9F41-00A024BB830C
        Logical name : SASApp - Logical Workspace Server
        Server context : SASApp
        Bridge port : 8591
        Machine name : wrkhost.abc.xyz.com


If your site has a complex setup, you may have multiple Object Spawners and/or Workspace Servers.
If so, it's possible that the Workspace Server you want to use is only spawnable for a particular
Object Spawner. You can correlate those by looking for the name of your Workspace Server in the
'Spawnable server component :' of the Object Spawner output. 

Also, if you have multiple Workspace Server that you want to be able to connect to, you can define
a separate configuration definition (in your sascfg[_personal].py) for each one. A good naming 
convention for these is to use the 'Server context :' value as the config name. That way it's easy
to know which server you will be connecting to.


**************************************************************
Disconnecting from an IOM session and reconnecting back to it.
**************************************************************

The IOM access method has the ability to disconnect from the workspace server and
reconnect to it (the same one); IF the reconnect setting is configured for that workspace
server in the Metadata Server. See 'Client Reconnect' Advanced Options of the Workspace Server.
This feature is new in version 2.2.2.

This was implemented for cases like having a laptop in a docking station, connected to LAN (Ethernet).
Then needing to take the laptop to a meeting; network switched to WiFi. Switching the network will lose
the connection to the workspace server.

In order to have this work, before disconnecting from your current network, you submit the disconnect()
method of the SASsession object. You can then change networks. After you have a good network connection again,
the next thing you submit will reconnect to that same workspace server and run.
 

.. code-block:: ipython3

    sas = saspy.SASsession(cfgname='someIOMconfig')
    [do some work with saspy]
    sas.disconnect()
    [switch networks. be sure you have established a network connection]
    do more saspy work


*******************************************************************
Configuring Grid Option Sets to have saspy run on a specific Queue.
*******************************************************************

Working with Grid Options Sets is documented here (the 'Doc' referred to below):
http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/gridref/67371/HTML/default/viewer.htm#n1inymfs0b7go2n147xdknz0ygpx.htm

There is also a SASPy issue with details on this here: 
https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy/issues/82

This is specific to the IOM Access Method, as that is how saspy connects to the SAS Grid with this functionality.
The Appname that saspy connects as is 'SASPy'; as in APPNAME=SASPy 
 
There are 2 steps to setting this up. The first is to define the SASPy Application in metadata and set it as Grid Capable.
That part in the doc (link referenced above) is at the bottom, named 'Specifying That an Application Is Grid Capable'. 

The second is to select and configure that SASPy App in the Grid Options Set Mapping Wizard; the first part of the doc. 

1) in the 'Folders' view in SMC (like in the picture in the doc link), there's a list of applications. The doc has the SAS Addin for Microsoft Office selected.
If you right click on Applications, you can selct 'New'->'Folder.

2) Do that and set the name of the new folder to SASPy. Then right click and select Properties - just like in the picture in the doc. 
Then add a Keyword-> 'isGridCapable' and save it. Just like the picture in the doc.

After creating the SASPy folder (application), and setting it to grid capable, when you go back in to the grid options mapping wizard (the first part
of the document referenced above), SASPy should now be available to choose and you can set this up as you want.
