The tests in this directory can be run by changing to the saspy_pip directory (above saspy) and
running the following command. There may be other ways to run these, but this works so far. You
can specify specific tests on this command instead of the discovery, like in the second example.
Specs for unittest: https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/unittest.html

python3 -m unittest discover -s saspy/tests

python3 -m unittest saspy/tests/test_test1.py
