# These need path to SASHome and version number - python Dict
# The default path to the sas start up script is: /opt/sasinside/SASHome/SASFoundation/9.4/sas
# A usual install path is: /opt/sasinside/SASHome
#
# Since python uses utf-8, running SAS with encoding=utf-8 is the expected use case. By default
# linux SAS runs in Latin1, which works fine as long as you stick with the lower half of the code page.
# SAS is installed with a link ('sas') to the bin/sas_en startup script, and the link can be swapped
# to point to the utf8 start up script (bin/sas_u8), or another link made (sasutf8) to point to that.  
#
# valid keys are:
# 'saspath' - path to SAS startup script i.e.: /opt/sasinside/SASHome/SASFoundation/9.4/sas
# 'options' - SAS options to include in the start up command line - Python List
