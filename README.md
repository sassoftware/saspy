# SASPy

SASPy is a python module which allows python to connect to SAS 9.4 and run SAS code,
generated by the supplied object and methods or explicitly user written, and returns
results as text, HTML5 documents (via SAS ODS), or as Pandas Data Frames. It supports running
analytics and returning the resulting graphics and result data. It can convert between SAS Data
Sets and Pandas Data Frames. It has multiple access methods which allow it to connect to
local or remote Linux SAS, IOM SAS on Windows or Linux (Including Grid Manager),
local PC SAS, and, in the future, the Compute Service (SAS Viya micro service replacing IOM).
It can run w/in Jupyter Notebooks, in line mode python or in python batch scripts. It is
expected that the user community can and will contribute enhancements. 

## Requirements

**SASPy** requires Python3.x or above. It also requires SAS 9.4 or above.
